      <p>Click anywhere on the screen to launch a rocket.
The rocket will explode alone when it reaches the clicked point on the screen if it does not hit any asteroid.</p>

        When the rocket hits an asteroid directly, the asteroid will explode and also release materials that you can use to upgrade your base.</p>
